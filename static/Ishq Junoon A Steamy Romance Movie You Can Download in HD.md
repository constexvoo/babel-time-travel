Ishq Junoon is not a typical Bollywood movie that follows the formula of romance, comedy and drama. It is a movie that challenges the norms of society and explores the concept of polyamory, which means having multiple romantic partners at the same time. Polyamory is not widely accepted or understood in India, where monogamy is the dominant form of relationship. Ishq Junoon tries to show the positive and negative sides of polyamory, and how it affects the lives of the people involved.
 
The movie revolves around Pakhi (Divya Singh), a young and beautiful girl who falls in love with Raj (Rajbeer Singh), a handsome and wealthy businessman. However, their relationship is not smooth, as Raj has a secret that he hides from Pakhi. Raj is already in love with Veer (Akshay Rangshahi), his childhood friend and business partner. Raj and Veer share a deep bond that goes beyond friendship. They are also sexually attracted to each other and have a physical relationship.
 
When Pakhi finds out about Raj and Veer's affair, she is shocked and heartbroken. However, instead of leaving Raj, she decides to join them in their unconventional relationship. She develops feelings for both Raj and Veer, and they also accept her as their third partner. The three of them start living together in a happy and passionate arrangement. However, their happiness is short-lived, as they face various challenges from their families, friends and society. They also have to deal with jealousy, insecurity and betrayal among themselves. Will they be able to sustain their polyamorous relationship or will they fall apart?
