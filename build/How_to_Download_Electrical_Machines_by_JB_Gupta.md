#### How to Optimize Your Article for SEO
 
Writing a good article is not enough if you want to rank well on search engines. You also need to optimize your article for SEO, which means making it easy for search engines to understand and rank your content. Here are some tips on how to optimize your article for SEO:
 
- Use keywords in the right places. Keywords are the words and phrases that users type into search engines to find what they are looking for. You should use your main keyword in your title, URL, headings, and first paragraph of your article. You should also use related keywords throughout your article to show the relevance and depth of your content. However, don't overuse keywords or stuff them unnaturally, as this can hurt your rankings and user experience.
- Keep users on your site longer. Search engines measure how long users stay on your site after clicking on your link. This is called dwell time, and it's an indicator of how engaging and useful your content is. The longer users stay on your site, the better your rankings will be. To keep users on your site longer, you should write clear and compelling content, use attractive images and videos, break up long paragraphs with subheadings and bullet points, and provide internal links to other relevant pages on your site.
- Find âsuggestâ keywords. Suggest keywords are the keywords that appear as suggestions when you type something into Google or other search engines. These keywords are based on what other users have searched for, and they can help you find new ideas and topics for your article. You can use tools like AnswerThePublic or Keyword Tool to find suggest keywords related to your main keyword.
- Delete zombie pages. Zombie pages are pages on your site that don't get any traffic or engagement from users or search engines. These pages can drag down your site's overall authority and rankings, as they waste crawl budget and dilute your link equity. You should delete or improve any zombie pages on your site, such as outdated or duplicate content, thin or low-quality content, or pages with technical errors.
- Do an industry study. An industry study is a type of content that provides original data and insights on a specific topic or niche. Industry studies are great for SEO because they attract links, citations, and social shares from other authoritative sources in your industry. They also showcase your expertise and credibility, which can boost your reputation and trustworthiness. To do an industry study, you need to conduct research, analyze data, and present your findings in a clear and engaging way.

These are some of the most important SEO tips for higher rankings. By following these tips, you can optimize your article for SEO and increase your chances of reaching more potential customers online.
