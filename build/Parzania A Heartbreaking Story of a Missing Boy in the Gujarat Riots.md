The 2002 Gujarat riots were a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat. The burning of a train in Godhra on 27 February 2002, which caused the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims and karsevaks returning from Ayodhya, is cited as having instigated the violence. Following the incident, Hindu mobs attacked Muslim communities across Gujarat, killing over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, and displacing over 200,000 people.
 
The riots have been widely condemned as a state-sponsored pogrom against Muslims, with allegations of complicity and inaction by the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and his government. Several investigations and commissions have been set up to probe the role of the state authorities and the police in the riots. The Supreme Court of India has also intervened in several cases related to the riots, transferring some of them outside Gujarat and ordering retrials.
 
Parzania depicts the impact of the riots on one family who loses their son in the chaos. The film shows how they struggle to cope with their loss and their quest for justice. The film also portrays the human rights violations and the lack of accountability that marked the riots. The film raises important questions about communal harmony, secularism and democracy in India.

Parzania is not just a film about a missing boy, but also a film about the missing humanity in a society torn by communal hatred. The film exposes the ugly realities of the riots and the failure of the state to protect its citizens. The film also celebrates the resilience and courage of the victims and their families who refuse to give up hope and fight for their rights.
 
The film has received critical acclaim from various national and international film festivals and critics. The film has also faced resistance and censorship from some groups who have objected to its portrayal of the riots and the role of the state. The film was banned in Gujarat and faced difficulties in getting a theatrical release in other parts of India. The film has also been praised for its performances, especially by Naseeruddin Shah and Sarika, who won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her role.
 
Parzania is a film that deserves to be watched by everyone who cares about human rights, justice and peace. The film is a powerful reminder of the horrors of communal violence and the need for communal harmony. The film is also a tribute to the spirit of Parzan and his family, who represent the hope and dignity of humanity.
